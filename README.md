# gedit-ansys-lang
Gedit language definition file for ansys apdl syntax highlighting

## Installation
Copy the apdl.lang file to `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/ folder`.

As of now, the syntax highlighting works for \*.ans, \*.mac and \*.inp files. If you want apdl highlighting for more files, edit line 23 of the lang file.

## Troubleshooting
If the syntax highlighting did not work at all, you could try changing the folder from `.../gknsourceview-2.0/...` to `.../gknsourceview-3.0/...` or `.../gknsourceview-4.0/...`
